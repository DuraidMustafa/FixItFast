# ⚡ FixItFast

FixItFast is a fast-paced, web-based debugging arena where developers compete to fix broken code under pressure.  
From JavaScript bugs to DOM glitches and broken React components — this is where real-world frontend problem-solving gets serious.

> Think you can fix it faster than the rest? Time to prove it.

## 🎯 What is FixItFast?

FixItFast is a multiplayer-ready platform for developers to practice real-world debugging challenges.  
Each challenge contains broken code, and your mission is to **fix it to pass all test cases**. You can play solo or (soon) against others in real-time.

This project helps you build deep skills in:

- Reading unfamiliar or legacy code
- Identifying and resolving real frontend issues
- Working with real test environments
- Thinking fast under pressure
